# Security Enhancements Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implemented Enhancements

### 1. Input Validation with Zod Schemas
**Status: COMPLETE**

Created comprehensive validation schemas in `src/lib/validation.ts`:
- ✅ Domain validation with sanitization
- ✅ Calculator form validation (traffic, transaction values)
- ✅ Authentication form validation (email, password)
- ✅ Password strength requirements (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers)
- ✅ Email format validation and sanitization

**Impact:** Prevents injection attacks, malformed data, and improves data quality.

### 2. Input Sanitization with DOMPurify
**Status: COMPLETE**

Added DOMPurify library and sanitization utilities:
- ✅ `sanitizeInput()` - Strips all HTML tags, keeping only text
- ✅ `sanitizeHtml()` - Allows safe HTML tags for rich content
- ✅ `cleanAndValidateDomain()` - Domain-specific cleaning with sanitization

**Impact:** Prevents XSS attacks and malicious HTML injection.

### 3. Rate Limiting for Edge Functions
**Status: COMPLETE**

Implemented rate limiting across all edge functions:
- ✅ `save-report`: 50 requests/15 minutes (write operations)
- ✅ `get-report`: 300 requests/15 minutes (read operations)
- ✅ `track-share`: 100 requests/15 minutes (analytics)
- ✅ Returns 429 status with Retry-After header when exceeded

**Impact:** Prevents abuse, DDoS attacks, and resource exhaustion.

### 4. Enhanced Error Messages
**Status: COMPLETE**

Updated error handling to prevent information disclosure:
- ✅ Generic authentication errors (no "user exists" leaks)
- ✅ Sanitized database error messages
- ✅ Consistent error format across all endpoints
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging (server-side only)

**Impact:** Prevents user enumeration and information leakage attacks.

### 5. Enhanced Input Validation in Edge Functions
**Status: COMPLETE**

Added comprehensive validation in edge functions:
- ✅ Type checking for all inputs
- ✅ Length validation for strings
- ✅ Platform validation for social sharing
- ✅ Required field validation

**Impact:** Prevents malformed requests and potential exploits.

## 🔒 Security Features Already in Place

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Proper JWT-based authentication with Supabase
- ✅ Admin role verification via `is_admin()` RPC
- ✅ Secure session management with localStorage
- ✅ Email confirmation flow

### Database Security
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- ✅ Comprehensive RLS policies for all operations
- ✅ Admin role separation (admin, super_admin, user)
- ✅ Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Data Access Control
- ✅ User-specific data isolation via RLS
- ✅ Admin-only endpoints properly secured
- ✅ Public report access controlled by `is_public` flag
- ✅ IP address hashing for privacy

## ⚠️ Manual Configuration Required

### Priority 1: Supabase Auth Settings
You need to enable leaked password protection in Supabase:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/apjlauuidcbvuplfcshg/auth/providers
2. Scroll to "Password Settings"
3. Enable "Check for leaked passwords" (HaveIBeenPwned integration)
4. Review minimum password length (currently set to 8 in code)

### Priority 2: Review Password Policy
Consider strengthening password requirements:
- Current: 8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number
- Recommended: Add special character requirement
- Update `authPasswordSchema` in `src/lib/validation.ts` if needed

## 📊 Security Status

| Area | Status | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Input Validation | ✅ Complete | High |
| Input Sanitization | ✅ Complete | High |
| Rate Limiting | ✅ Complete | High |
| Error Handling | ✅ Complete | Medium |
| Authentication | ✅ Secure | High |
| Authorization | ✅ Secure | High |
| RLS Policies | ✅ Secure | Critical |
| Password Protection | ⚠️ Manual Setup | High |
| Audit Logging | ✅ Complete | Medium |

## 🔐 Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation (client + server)
2. **Least Privilege**: RLS policies enforce minimum necessary access
3. **Fail Securely**: Default deny on all database operations
4. **Separation of Duties**: Admin roles properly segregated
5. **Privacy by Design**: IP hashing, no PII logging
6. **Secure Error Handling**: No information disclosure in errors

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Short Term (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Implement request logging middleware
- [ ] Add CAPTCHA for auth endpoints (if bot traffic detected)

### Medium Term (2-4 hours)
- [ ] Set up Supabase Auth hooks for additional validation
- [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Add email notification for suspicious activities

### Long Term (Ongoing)
- [ ] Regular security audits and penetration testing
- [ ] Monitor edge function logs for anomalies
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated (run `npm audit` regularly)
- [ ] Review and update RLS policies as features evolve

## 📝 Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Input Validation**:
   - Try submitting forms with XSS payloads
   - Test with extremely long inputs
   - Try SQL injection patterns

2. **Test Rate Limiting**:
   - Make repeated requests to edge functions
   - Verify 429 responses after limit

3. **Test Authentication**:
   - Try weak passwords (should fail)
   - Test with invalid emails
   - Verify error messages don't leak info

4. **Test Authorization**:
   - Try accessing admin endpoints without auth
   - Verify users can only access their own data
